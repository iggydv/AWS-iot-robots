# Controlling a sphero robot with a Raspberry Pi & AWS IoT Cloud


The robot that was used, was a [Sphero Sprk+](https://www.sphero.com/sphero-sprk-plus). Sphero is a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device that can move around and change colour. It has a top speed of 2 meters per second (!) and you'd be surprised to see how much it can do.

For this project myself and a friend, controlled one sphero with the gyroscopic sensor of another sphero.

The project was successful, but there are more than a few improvements that can be made.
